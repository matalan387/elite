Build an app to replace the current spreadsheet used for rating and ranking the parkruns and greasy spoon cafes
Essential:
- Create an event with parkrun location, cafe name, and date
- Rank event based on 5 criteria parkrun ease, parkrun vibes, cafe vibes, cafe price, cafe portion
- Save event in backend so that it isn't lost when restarting/refreshing
Spreadsheet with scores **https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yioSSFopIctYuiEoXnjaBsXZFicQ9lRNoGUIwbZ2MW4/edit?usp=sharing**

Future developments:
- Leaderboard with parkruns completed in SELERBA
- Improve UI to match the colour scheme of the t-shirts
- Allow pictures/album to be added
